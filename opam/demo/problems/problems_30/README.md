- Prob14.c: Simulates an elevator door controller with floor-aware timing logic, while enforcing a critical obstruction override that forces doors to open regardless of user commands or profiles. It maintains a strict safety invariant by bounding motor force at all times and conditionally preventing closing force whenever an obstruction is detected. "gcc prob14.c"
- Prob15.c: Simulates an elevator dispatch controller that balances passenger wait times and operational states to issue service, maintenance, or recall commands. A fire alarm acts as a dominant safety override, forcing a fire-recall command and enforcing a strict safety condition that forbids any other command while the alarm is active. "gcc prob15.c"

- Prob17.c: Simulates a furnace ignition controller that opens the gas valve when heat is requested and monitors flame detection during ignition. If a flame is not detected within a defined timeout, a safety override shuts the valve and manages retries to prevent unsafe gas accumulation. "gcc prob17.c"
- Prob18.c: Simulates an HVAC damper controller that adjusts airflow based on thermostat input, while a fire alarm provides a critical safety override that forces the damper to a safe closed position. It includes logic for normal cooling operation, system-off states, and enforces damper position limits to ensure safe operation. "gcc prob18.c"

- Prob20.c: Simulates a medical infusion pump with complex control logic, adjusting the pump rate based on a drug profile while enforcing gradual ramp-up limits. It includes critical safety features: an air-in-line sensor stops the pump immediately, and a non-trivial sustained high-rate lockout prevents prolonged operation near the profile's maximum. "gcc prob20.c"

"gcc prob22.c"
- Prob23.c: Simulates an advanced natural-gas pipeline pressure regulator that adjusts a valve based on downstream demand while enforcing rate limits and recovery hysteresis. It implements a non-trivial safety invariant that latches the system into an emergency shutdown under overpressure or sensor faults, guaranteeing the valve closes and remains within safe operational bounds. "gcc prob23.c" 
- Prob24.c: Simulates an advanced railway signal controller that follows a timetable under normal conditions but enforces multiple fail-safe overrides for track occupancy, communication loss, and sensor faults. It explicitly encodes and checks a complex safety invariant that forbids unsafe GREEN signals and ensures the system always remains in a valid, verifiable state. "gcc prob24.c"
- Prob25.c: Simulates a robotic arm controller that computes motor torque using position error, speed profiles, and slew-rate limiting, while handling normal motion and disabled states. It enforces a complex safety invariant in code, ensuring collisions, sensor faults, and invalid torque direction or magnitude immediately force safe torque behavior. "gcc prob25.c"
- Prob26.c: Simulates a satellite solar array controller that tracks the sun during normal operation but switches to conservative or safe orientations when thermal limits, sensor disagreements, or actuator faults occur. A formally encoded safety condition guarantees the array angle always remains within physical bounds and enforces a fixed safe-mode angle whenever critical faults or overheating are detected. "gcc prob26.c"
- Prob27.c: Simulates a solar panel tracking controller that dynamically switches between sun-tracking modes while enforcing slew limits and sensor validation. It includes a latched high-wind safety override with hysteresis and a formal safety condition ensuring bounded actuator motion, correct stow behavior, and fail-safe responses to sensor faults. "gcc prob27.c"
- Prob28.c: Simulates a submarine ballast tank controller that manages depth using pump actions based on a target depth command while monitoring hull pressure and descent rate. Critical safety logic overrides normal control to force an emergency surface when crush depth risk or rapid unsafe descent is detected. "gcc prob28.c"
- Prob29.c: Simulates aircraft speed control driven by turbine speed and environmental factors, using a smoothed thrust model to update speed over time.

"gcc prob29.c"
- Prob30.c: Simulates an advanced chlorine dosing controller that combines flow-based feed-forward control, feedback from measured chlorine levels, trend damping, and rate limiting to determine pump output. A multi-clause safety condition enforces strict bounds and override dominance, ensuring the pump is shut down during high-chlorine alarms and never operates outside safe limits. "gcc prob30.c"
