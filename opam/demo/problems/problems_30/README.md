# 30 Problems
This folder contains 30 pid controller type programs to be used for experimental benchmarking.

## Problems & Descriptions:
- Prob1.c: Simulates a stateful feedback controller that updates turbine speed to drive aircraft speed toward a target using past error history. At every iteration, it updates aircraft speed deterministically and enforces safety by bounding the speed, limiting abrupt changes, and ensuring long-term monotonic progress. "gcc prob1.c -lm"
- Prob2.c: Simulates a stateful anesthesia gas mixer that enforces a hard safety override when oxygen pressure is low and gradually restores anesthetic delivery once conditions recover. At every step, it guarantees bounded, monotonic, and rate-limited anesthetic output while conditionally ignoring patient inputs during emergencies. "gcc prob2.c"
- Prob3.c: Simulates a greenhouse vent controller that prioritizes wind safety by forcibly closing vents during high winds and cautiously reopening them once conditions improve. It guarantees bounded, rate-limited, and mode-dependent vent behavior while conditionally ignoring temperature targets during safety overrides. "gcc prob3.c"
- Prob4.c: Simulates a welding robot controller that immediately halts all motion when a human enters the safety zone and resumes movement cautiously after clearance.
It guarantees valid motor commands and enforces mode-dependent, history-aware safety constraints that override the programmed path when necessary. "gcc prob4.c"
- Prob5.c: Simulates a stateful automotive ABS controller that modulates brake pressure based on wheel slip and road conditions, while tracking operating modes across iterations. A fault-dominant safety override enforces bounded, non-amplifying brake commands and disables all conditional logic whenever system integrity is compromised. "gcc prob5.c"
- Prob6.c: Simulates a stateful autonomous lawn mower controller that manages blade operation based on terrain stability and GPS-driven mowing intent. A tilt-dominant safety override enforces immediate blade shutdown and a guarded recovery sequence, ensuring blades are never reactivated under unsafe conditions. "gcc prob6.c"
- Prob7.c: Simulates a stateful battery management system that regulates charging current based on cell voltage, temperature, charger connection, and user-selected charging profiles. It enforces layered safety overrides that immediately stop charging during electrical or thermal faults and only allow a controlled, safe restart once conditions return to normal. "gcc prob7.c"
- Prob8.c: Simulates a chemical reactor controller that adjusts the heater duty cycle based on the reaction phase to maintain target temperatures, while using a cooling system as needed. A critical over-pressure sensor provides a safety override, immediately cutting heating and maximizing cooling, ignoring the normal temperature control logic. "gcc prob8.c"
- Prob9.c: Controls a conveyor belt’s speed based on item weight while enforcing a jam-safety override that halts the motor immediately. It ensures smooth acceleration/deceleration, maintains motor speed within safe bounds, and enforces state-dependent safety logic during normal, slow-start, and emergency-stop modes. "gcc prob9.c"
- Prob10.c: Simulates a stateful dam spillway controller that adjusts gate opening based on reservoir level and seasonal demand, while prioritizing an emergency flood override.
It enforces safety by forcing full gate opening during floods and ensuring a bounded, gradual recovery to normal operation once the emergency clears. "gcc prob10.c"
